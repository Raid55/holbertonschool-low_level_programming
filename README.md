DISCLAIMER
All READMES in the repo are currently all placeholders... they are work in proggress, Im not that good with markdown, and to be quite frank its not my cup of tea, altho, I understand that good documentation makes good code, therefore I will commite my break time to go over and try my best to have good readmes for each of my mini-projects. Thanks for understanding and have an excellent rest of day!
